# final_project_nhl_prediction

Project goals: To build an machine learning model which predicts the winner of NHL games with an accuracy of 60% or higher. 

Secondary goal: To find effective betting stragies (using above model) to acheive a return on investment of 15% or higher.

Results so far (as of Aug 13, 2021):

1. Two or more models have acheived an accuracy of 59% or higher on on 2016-17 data.
2. The current (rather basic) betting strategy was simulated and achieved an ROI of 5% on 2016-17 data and 7% on 2017-18 data.

Note on Results: 

I will report more details on which models I used, and how I structured the training in the next week or so (as of Aug 13, 2021).

General Notes: 

This is a pretty raw version of my final two week project at Lighthouse Labs (a 12 week data science bootcamp), which I started July 29 and completed August 11, 2021. I will be cleaning up the project in the next week and then continuing to work on it and improve it in the coming weeks.

I apologize for the disorganization and many files present in it the project at the moment and I will be rectifying that soon! 
In the mean time, hopefully one can at least get a rough idea of the project even in its current state (as of Aug 13, 2021).
